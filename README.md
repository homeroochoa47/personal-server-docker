## üìç Overview

This project was originally my portfolio website, which turned into an experiment with deploying a Django project with AWS in a docker container. It stored and retrieved personal and project information from a PostgreSQL database in AWS RDS, and used NGNIX in a docker container to serve the project from an EC2 instance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a typical Django architecture, with a separation of concerns into different modules for models, views, tests, and configurations. It utilizes Docker for containerization and Nginx as a reverse proxy server for serving the application. The architecture allows for scalability and ease of deployment.    |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The primary dependencies for this project are Django, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, Nginx, and Docker. Django provides the web framework, PostgreSQL is used as the database, Gunicorn runs the application server, and Nginx handles reverse proxy. Docker is used for containerization. These external libraries and systems enable the reliable development and deployment of the project.    |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The project exhibits good modularity by separating functionality into distinct Django modules, such as models, views, and tests. Each module has a specific purpose, making them easier to understand and modify. This modularity enables better code maintenance and reusability.    |
| **üîê Security**        | The project does not have explicit security measures documented in the repository. However, Django provides built-in security features such as CSRF protection, secure session management, built-in defenses against common web vulnerabilities, and authentication and authorization systems. Security best practices, such as secure site configurations and regular security audits, can further enhance the system's security posture.    |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | Git has been used for version control in this project, as evidenced by the repository link. The team can leverage Git's branching and merging capabilities for collaborative development, code review, and managing different versions or feature branches. However, the repository does not mention any specific version control strategies or tools beyond using Git itself.    |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The codebase integrates with PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval. Additionally, Docker is used to create a Docker container for the application, and Nginx is utilized as a reverse proxy server for serving the Django application. These integrations enhance the resilience, ease of deployment, and flexibility
